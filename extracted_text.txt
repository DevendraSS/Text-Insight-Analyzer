Starc to Shahbaz Ahmed,
out
Bowled!! Mitch Starc is on fire. He's
got three and is on a hat-trick as well.
Bowls a pacy length delivery around off and Shahbaz's lack of feet on the poke meant he got a thick inside edge that flew back to dislodge the middle stump. A nothing shot and SRH are 4 down inside 5 overs.

Starc to Nitish Reddy,
out
Caught by Gurbaz!! Too easy. Mitchell Starc has played enough cricket to understand what and when to bowl inside the powerplay. After trying out a few length balls, he goes for the bumper outside off. Cramps Nitish Reddy up for room and induces a thick top-edge that's been safely snaffled by the keeper to his left.
